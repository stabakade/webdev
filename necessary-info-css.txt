External css: <link rel="stylesheet" href="filename.css">
!important used to take precedence over everything

fonts website: Cssfonts, googlefonts 
always keep box model image handy, and apply element, padding, border, margin from chrome developer console
and don't ignore the color so that you can directly from the dev console

to apply to every element
* {

}
width + padding + border = actual width of an element
height + padding + border = actual height of an element
hence we use box-sizing

Clear and float:
we use flexbox instead of float tho!
before alignment with clear and float, we first set width of container
in which our elements are
In alignment, set width in percentage and try with same direction float first!
clear: left means koi bhi float left element ki overlapping mere pe allowed nai hai

button:
cursor pointer, text-decoration
a:hover and a:visited these are pseudo selectors
a:hover {
    color: red;
}

Navigation Menu:
to give css to something inside, navbar is class  
        .navbar li{
            
        }
to remove bullet points after using float, list-styling: none
to retain our background color which is lost due to float,         
            .navbar ul {
                overflow: auto;
            }
